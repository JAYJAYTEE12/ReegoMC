# ReegoMC

An open-source Minecraft plugin for the Minecraft server ReegoMC.
Feel free to have a look around. Everything here is for you to use outside the project.

But if you clone the repo, change the name, and say you made the plugin then I will be very sad :(

## Discalimer

This plugin is hosted on the ReegoMC server, although the versions on github and the server may not be synced.
This plugin has only been tested on Paper 1.12.2 servers. This will probably not change in the future so if you're getting issues on different server software don't open an issue.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
